Description: 
    Yeastspot3D provides an easy and comprehensive framework to do the 
    mutation mapping analysis for yeast through integrating the genome 
    annotation, protein structure quality analysis and mutation mapping 
    analysis together. With Yeastspot3D, the mutation enrichment 
    analysis and mutation hotspot analysis can be done at the same time.
    Yeastspot3D makes it easy to find the interest proteins with 
    significant mutation enrichment within a protein 3D structure.
